Your computer probably comes with a text editor, such as Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Mac. Open a new doc, type your information, and save it as README.md (with TextEdit, you might have to save it as .rf first, then change the extension in your Finder.)

If you want to do it from the comfort of RStudio, you can create a new RMarkdown file, and save it while changing the extension from .Rmd to .md.
